A model cannot fight with a throwing weapon in the Fight phase.\n\nA throwing weapon can be used as its bearer Charges into combat. The player moves the model as if it were going to Charge the enemy, but instead of moving into base contact with their foe, they stop 1\" away. They then throw the weapon at the enemy they are about to Charge. This shot is resolved using the rules for shooting, even though it takes place in the Move phase. Throwing weapons thrown as a model Charges into combat do not suffer the -1 penalty for moving and shooting.\n\nIf the target is not slain, the charger then moves into base contact with the same enemy model. If the original target is slain, the charger may complete their move in any way the controlling player wishes \u2013 stopping straight away, charging another target or anything in between.\n\nThrowing Weapons do not count towards an army\u2019s bow limit. Throwing spears follow the rules for throwing weapons, but have a slightly different profile (see the Missile Weapon chart)."
