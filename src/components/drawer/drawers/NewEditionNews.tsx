    <Typography>Hello everyone!</Typography>
    <Typography>
      Games Workshop has announced that a new edition for MESBG will be released
      in the near future. You can find one of the latest announcements here,
      describing some of the incoming changes...

        Middle-earthâ„¢ Strategy Battle Game - The upcoming range update,
        explained

      Based on the news so far, a lot of profiles are being reworked, along with
      a new array of army lists and various rule changes. This is likely going
      to result in a very large amount of work for me once it is released,
      particularly for profile cards. I will definitely be working hard to bring
      you updates that support the new edition of the game on this website.

      My plan is to maintain two versions of this list builder, one for the new
      edition, and one for the old edition. I may be able to better estimate the
      time and effort it will require as more details are released over the
      coming months. As a matter of tempering expectations, I&apos;d like to
      disclaim in advance that it could take many weeks to fully support all of
      the changes.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      In the meantime, thank you for all your support and kind words over the
      past year. It has meant a great deal to me. I appreciate your patience for
      what&apos;s to come in future as I transition this website over to
      supporting the new edition.

    <Typography>Thank you.</Typography>
