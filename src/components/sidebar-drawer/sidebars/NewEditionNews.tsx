    <b>17th August 2024 - Message from avcordaro</b>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>
      Games Workshop has announced that a new edition for MESBG will be released
      in the near future. You can find one of the latest announcements here,
      describing some of the incoming changes...

        The Road Goes Ever On and On… The Next Edition of Middle-earth™
        Strategy Battle Game

      You can see in the article above that a lot of profiles are being
      reworked, along with a new array of army lists and various rule changes.
      This is likely going to result in a very large amount of work for me once
      it is released, particularly for profile cards. I will definitely be
      working hard to bring you updates that support the new edition of the game
      on this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      My plan is to maintain two versions of this list builder, one for the new
      edition, and one for the old edition. I may be able to better estimate the
      time and effort it will require as more details are released over the
      coming months. As a matter of tempering expectations, I&apos;d like to
      disclaim in advance that it could take many weeks to fully support all of
      the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, thank you for all your support and kind words over the
      past year. It has meant a great deal to me. I appreciate your patience for
      what&apos;s to come in future as I transition this website over to
      supporting the new edition.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
